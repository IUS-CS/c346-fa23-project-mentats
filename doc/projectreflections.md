## Backend Developer, QA, Documentation
### Zachary Nelson

Throughout this project I worked on the backend, as well as testing and documentation. Initially we were using Java
with Spring boot for our backend, and we soon learned that different frameworks have their benefits and limitations, 
leading us to switch frameworks. Another important lesson from this was to consider additional tools even if they are
outside an area of expertise. 

Throughout project development, ensuring testing was an important part in deciding if a sprint's goals had been 
achieved. While using Spring boot and a remote database, it was difficult to test if SQL requests were going through due 
to framework issues; costing extra time and additional sprints to resolve the issue. Reliably testing features became
an important part of our development. 

Testing naturally leads to documentation
