## Backend Developer, QA, Documentation
### Zachary Nelson

Throughout this project I worked on the backend, as well as testing and documentation. Initially we were using Java
with Spring boot for our backend, and we soon learned that different frameworks have their benefits and limitations, 
leading us to switch frameworks. Another important lesson from this was to consider additional tools even if they are
outside an area of expertise, such as Rust and Actix Web. 

Throughout project development, ensuring testing was an important part in deciding if a sprint's goals had been 
achieved. While using Spring boot and a remote database, it was difficult to test if SQL requests were going through due 
to framework issues; costing extra time and additional sprints to resolve the issue. One thing I would change is 
adopting a different framework earlier. Reliably testing features became an important part of our development. 

Testing naturally leads to documentation. Documentation became an important resource, even in our group of four. 
Creating detailed diagrams of software architecture ensured there was a common vision in sprint planning.  
Documentation of testing was needed to ensure reliability and compatibility of frameworks or libraries.
As the software is continuously evolving, I would expect the documentation should as well.
