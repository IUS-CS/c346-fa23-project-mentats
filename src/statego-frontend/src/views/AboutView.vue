         <p class="flex w-full justify-center pb-5 pr-5 font-Nunito-Sans text-lg">I coded all of the backend of this site. I started with Java, which was
            a real pain in the neck, the learned that authorization was something that I found extremely difficult in Java. So we decided to switch the
            backend to rust, which was much less cumbersome. It allowed us to be able to do authorization and connect to the database easily.

         <p class="flex w-full justify-center pr-5 font-Nunito-Sans text-lg">I did all of the documentation that can be found in the GitHub for this site's
            source code. All of the graphs and images and other things that you might see in there, I did. And I am very proud of my work on that. I also
            helped John with the backend of things and learning the language of Java, then ultimately switching to, and learning, rust.

         <p class="flex w-full justify-center pl-5 pb-5 font-Nunito-Sans text-lg">I am a freaking idiot. But ignoring that part of it, I worked on most of the
            frontend as well as the backend, as well as doing things behind the scenes such as attempting deployment and hosting the site as well. I also
            helped the others with a little less experience than me to learn a little bit about the frontend, how it works, and how it can be designed.

         <p class="flex w-full justify-center pb-5 pl-5 font-Nunito-Sans text-lg">I am a student at IUS majoring in Computer Science. I worked on the design
            of this website along with Tyler. We wanted to create an enjoyable and sleek site for those who love to play RPGs or just plain board games,
            especially those long ones we just don't always have time for. We hope you enjoy using our site, and we enjoyed making it for you users!
